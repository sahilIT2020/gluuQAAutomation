	When 	I go to openid connect scopes list page 
	And 	I start the process to add new scope
	And 	I set the display name 'QaAddedScopeDN'
	And 	I set the description 'QaAddedScopeDes'
	And 	I set the scope type to 'OpenID'
	And 	I set dynamic registration to 'True'
	And 	I save the scope registration
	When 	I go to openid connect scopes list page
	And 	I search for openid scopes with pattern 'QaAddedScopeDN'
